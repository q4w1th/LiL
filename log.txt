Ayumi
Hello, asd, it's me, Ayumi!

asd
Nice to see you! Strange to meet again after so many years of chatting
online..

Ayumi
Hehe~ It is indeed strange, but I'm very happy to see you! How are you here?
Ready for studying?

asd
Your country is just amazing, but there's a lot I don't understand.. It would
be good to learn something about the culture and customs..

Ayumi
Great!~ I'll help you get used to Japanese culture, and as promised, I'll
introduce you to our classmates!

Ayumi
Oh, look, my.. I mean, our classmates, Takahashi and Ishito, are standing
nearby! Let's go meet them!!

Ayumi
Takahashi-san, Ishito-san!! Meet our new classmate, asd!

Choice: Hello, how is it going?
Choice: Hello, I'm from Poland, hoping to make friends with you all..

Player chose: Hello, how is it going?

Akane
I think exchange students shouldn't stay here for too long.

Ayumi
Akane has always been indifferent to everything, but don't mind her.

Ayumi
We're glad you're with us, and we'll help you feel comfortable in our country.

Rei
Yes, Ayumi is right. If you have any questions or need help, just ask us.

Thinking...
*Wow, Takahashi seems to have some mysterious aura..*

asd
Thank you all for the warm welcome. I'm really looking forward to getting to
know you.

Akane
I'm also glad to meet you. Now that we're acquainted, can we move on? I don't
want to be late for class.

Ayumi
Hmmm~ It's strange that Yuno-chan is nowhere to be seen. I asked her to come
out here.

Ayumi
By the way, how was your first meeting?

asd
I think Ishito doesn't seem very happy about our meeting..

Ayumi
Don't mind her; she always acts like that. I also don't get along with her
very well.
